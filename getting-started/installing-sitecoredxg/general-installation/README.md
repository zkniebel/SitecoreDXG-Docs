# General Installation

This section will walk you through the process of installing SitecoreDXG using the out of the box components provided with the software.

One of the things that should be noted about the default setup of SitecoreDXG using RabbitMQ is that **not all of the components need to be installed together on the same machine**. For example, the SitecoreDXG Generation Service can be on one server, while RabbitMQ is on another \(or cloud hosted\) and the middleman is on yet another server.

With that in mind, the following instructions will guide you through the installation.
