# Step 5: \(Optional\) Install the Default RabbitMQ Middleman in a Custom Location

You can optionally install the RabbitMQ Middleman in the location of your choosing. 

For example, if you plan to integrate SitecoreDXG into your CI/CD pipeline then you may wish to copy the RabbitMQ middleman to your CI/CD server. If you are using TeamCity, then you may wish to also install the [SitecoreDXG TeamCity Meta-Runner](/how-to/cicd/integrating-the-default-teamcity-rabbitmq-meta-runner.md) on your TeamCity server, for a seamless integration between TeamCity and the RabbitMQ middleman.

For more details on how the middleman chould be installed in a custom location and how it can be called from the command-line, see [Using the Default RabbitMQ Middleman and Trigger](/getting-started/using-sitecoredxg/using-the-default-rabbitmq-middleman-and-trigger.md).
