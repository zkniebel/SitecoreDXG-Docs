# Step 5: \(Optional\) Install the Default RabbitMQ Middleman in a Custom Location

You can optionally install the RabbitMQ Middleman in the location of your choosing. For example, if you plan to integrate SitecoreDXG into your CI/CD pipeline then you may wish to copy the RabbitMQ middleman to your CI/CD server. See [Using the Default RabbitMQ Middleman and Trigger](/getting-started/using-the-default-rabbitmq-middleman-and-trigger.md) for more details on how the middleman should be installed in a custom location and how it can be called from the command-line.
