# Installing SitecoreDXG

This section will walk you through how to install your components in order to get SitecoreDXG up and running.

SitecoreDXG is designed to be very flexible and extensible, and entire components can be replaced with custom ones built for your purposes. Where you should install each component may vary based on customizations/extensions that you've made, including the use of custom [middlemen](/architecture/roles.md) and custom [triggers](/architecture/roles.md). Some examples of complex installations will be covered in the [Advanced Installation](/getting-started/advanced-installation.md) section, whereas the [General Installation](/getting-started/general-installation.md) section will help you install SitecoreDXG using the default configuration.
