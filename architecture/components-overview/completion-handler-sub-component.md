# Completion Handler Sub-component

SitecoreDXG also ships with an example _completion handler_, helloWorld.js, to help those looking to create handlers for themselves. Because completion handler logic is generally specific to the requirements of the end-user's CD/CD architecture, no handlers are configured to be called by default for SitecoreDXG though a default handler can be set in the configuration.
