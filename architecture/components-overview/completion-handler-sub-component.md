# Completion Handler Sub-component

SitecoreDXG ships with an example _completion handler_, helloWorld.js, to help those looking to create handlers for themselves. Because completion handler logic is generally specific to the requirements of the end-user's CD/CD architecture, no handlers are configured to be called by default for SitecoreDXG though a default handler or set of handlers can be configured to run in the configuration for the SitecoreDXG Generation Service, should no handlers be specified to run.

See [Creating a Custom Completion Handler](/how-to/creating-a-custom-completion-handler.md) for more details on the example and how to write your own completion handlers.
