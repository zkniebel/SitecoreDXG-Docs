# Inheritance Relationship View

In SitecoreUML syntax, an _inheritance relationship view_ represents the inheritance relationship, or "generalization", of one entity and another.

Inheritance relationship views are depicted as a solid arrow connection between two entities, with a solid arrowhead connecting to the inherited template and the arrow's tail connecting to the source template, as shown in the diagram below.
