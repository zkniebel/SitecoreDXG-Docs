# Views

_Views_ are visual representations of your Sitecore templates, fields, folders, relationships, dependencies, diagrams and everything else that you see in the diagrams of your output documentation. 

The most important thing to remember about views is that everything you see in the diagrams is a view and each view has a [_model_](../models/) that holds the data for the view. The model holds the data for everything that you see, whereas the _views_ are the actual, visual entity.
