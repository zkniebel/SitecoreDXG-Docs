# Parent-Child Relationships of Models

SitecoreDXG visually displays the parent-child relationships of models in much the same way as Sitecore does in the Content Tree, by nesting child models under the parent model in the navigation pane. 

For example, in the below image note that the "Icon" template model is a child of the "Teasers" template folder model \(module root\), which is a child of the "Feature" template folder model \(layer root\).
