# Overview

SitecoreDXG is built on the open-source libraries of StarUML - the IDE on which SitecoreUML is based - and thus the data model of the generated output is the StarUML data model and is the same for both tools. 

The generated output documentation from SitecoreDXG includes a data model that consists of [_models_](models/), [_views_](views/) and [_diagrams_](diagrams/). Models define the actual data structures and relationships for everything in your architecture, and are displayed in the documentation similarly to a typical C\# class documentation page from MSDN; views are the visual, UML representation of a model; and diagrams are a grouping of zero or more views. 

For more information on the specific pieces of the SitecoreDXG output documentation, refer to the subsequent sections in this chapter.
