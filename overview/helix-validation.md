# Helix Dependency Validation

In version 1.1.0 of SitecoreDXG, Helix Dependency Validation is introduced to help development teams validate their template dependencies against the Helix guidelines. This is especially valuable when SitecoreDXG is [integrated into the team's CI/CD pipeline](../how-to/cicd/), as it means that validation run automatically each commit. The value is further compounded when [Slack and/or Microsoft Teams notifications](../how-to/slack-and-ms-teams-integration/) are configured to be sent on generation completion, as they will include a report of any validation errors that were detected.
