# CI/CD Integration

SitecoreDXG was specifically designed for ease of integration into CI/CD pipelines. As a command-line, Node.js-based tool, SitecoreDXG is very portable and can be integrated into any CI/CD pipeline with minimal effort. Additionally, the system was designed to be highly extensible, with plugins to support the customization of how you communicate with your SitecoreDXG server, how you trigger your generation, and what logic to call on completion.
